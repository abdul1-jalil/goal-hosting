    <p>I am currently doing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Systems Engineering at Mehran University of Engineering and Technology (MUET). </p>

    <h2>Year 1: Learning and Exploration</h2>
    <p>In my first year, I will focus on strengthening my understanding of core programming concepts and computer systems. I plan to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to start web development, and also explore C++ and Java for problem-solving and building logic.</p>

    <h2>Year 2: Skill Building and Projects</h2>
    <p>This year, I aim to start working on real-world projects, both individually and in teams. I will dive deeper into web development, learn backend technologies like Node.js, and develop complete applications. I’ll also participate in university competitions and hackathons.</p>

    <h2>Year 3: Internships and Industry Exposure</h2>
    <p>My third year will be focused on gaining practical experience through internships and freelancing. I want to understand how the industry works and apply my skills to solve actual problems. I’ll also start preparing for certifications in fields like cloud computing or cybersecurity.</p>

    <h2>Year 4: Specialization and Contribution</h2>
    <p>In the fourth year, I plan to specialize in an area that excites me the most, such as AI, networking, or software development. I aim to contribute to open-source projects, mentor junior students, and publish technical blogs or tutorials online.</p>

    <h2>Year 5: Career Launch and Entrepreneurship</h2>
    <p>After graduation, I plan to secure a full-time role at a reputed tech company or start my own software business. I want to work on innovative ideas, contribute to the tech ecosystem in Pakistan, and build solutions that positively impact society.</p>
